            <p>By 1974, Slade had become a big success in the UK, Europe and beyond, however the band felt that
                continuing
                to provide 'more of the same' was not what they wanted to do. Their manager Chas Chandler suggested
                they
                do a movie, to which the band agreed. To accompany the film, Holder and Lea began writing material
                for
                a soundtrack album, which would continue to see the band break out of their successful formula and
                try
                different musical ideas. "Far Far Away" was selected as the album's lead single and was released in
                October
                1974, reaching No. 2 in the UK. To accompany the film, Holder and Lea began writing material for a
